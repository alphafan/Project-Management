## Characteristics of a project
- Unique
- Temporary endeavor
- Defined start and end
- Create a specific product and service

## Constraints of a project
A place which may place imitations on 
- What you do
- How you do it
- When you do it

Example of constrains:
- If a project must occur on a specific date
- If a project doesn't have unlimited budget
- If there is a limit on how much manufactured can be outside of a country

## Role of project manager
- Oversee the success of a project
- Link between the strategy and the team
- Lead the team to success
- Needs to know: Risk management & Realistic schedule

## Type of team orgnization
- Fuunctinal Orgnization (职能组织)

In a Functional Organization, there is little to no project management. You might not be involved as a project manager. Sometimes there can be some project coordination involved. And that coordination takes place between the functional departments. Now by functional, I mean groups such as marketing, operations, finance, information technology. Each manager of each group oversees their part of the project. Employees working on the project may or may not know there's a project. They just might recognize that their manager has asked them to do something different than usual. There's probably limited conversation between team members, because they do not know they are a team. And there are probably no project team meetings. 
- Matrix Orgnization 

Now we're going to look at three types of matrix organizations, weak, balanced, and strong. The designation of weak, balanced, or strong has to do with who has more power or control over the project, the functional manager or the project manager. And remember that functional manager is someone who has a responsibility over a specific area and doesn't typically run projects. 
- In a weak matrix, the functional manager is in charge and he or she will probably have the assistance of a coordinator. The project coordinator will help maintain the schedule and the status and assist the functional manager, but the coordinator, not gonna have any decision making responsibility. 
- Within the balanced matrix, there's a recognition that having a project manager assigned will help to ensure success. And that project manager has some decision making responsibilities, but so does the functional manager. The project manager manages the team to stay within scope and schedule and budget. And the functional manager will make decisions as to who does the work and how that work is to be accomplished. 
- In a strong matrix, the project manager has much more responsibility and authority. But not complete responsibility and authority. He or she still cannot make all of the decisions. 
- Now when we talk about a projectized organization, this is where the project manager is king or queen. The team is dedicated, works on this one project, and the project manager will act as the manager of the team. Possibly even writing performance appraisals. So which one of these is the best organization? 

## What kind of structure is better in project orgnization?
Now that's a trick question. They all have their place. 
- For example, the __functional organization__ works very well for groups who do not run very many projects or for projects which are not complicated and not on a tight deadline.  
- The __Matrix Organizations__ work well when team members are going to be assigned to a combination of multiple projects and also other work. And in a matrix, team members could be assigned to quite a few projects. In a matrix situation, you as the project manager, most likely you're running multiple projects. As to which matrix is best, weak, balanced or strong? Well the PMI would ask us to consider strong because that is where the project manager has more power. And of course the PMI wants to see projects run by project managers, who are drawing upon the best practices. But sometimes a weak matrix is good, when the functional manager in charge has much of the required expertise and simply needs help with project coordination. 
- A __balanced matrix__ works well when it's easy to divide decision making and responsibility between the project manager and the functional manager. If it makes sense for the project manager to have more of the authority and the decision making, but not all of it, then a strong matrix could be the way to go. 

Now, a Projectized Organization is good for a very critical project, especially if time is of the essence. It is more expensive, because you take team members and put them all on one effort, and they were doing something before, so you probably have to backfill them. But the project gets all of the focus and attention that's required. There really is a time and a place for each of the project organizations. And in fact you'll find that some companies may use a combination of all or some depending on the project at hand. Now look at you. We started out with some basics such as what is a project. And now you have an idea as to what you will do as a project manager and how project teams can be structured.
